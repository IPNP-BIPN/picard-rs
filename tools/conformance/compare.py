"""The one comparator for every conformance suite.

Before this file existed, each suite carried its own copy of the same thirty lines of parsing
and diffing inside `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and the copies had already drifted: some skipped
comment lines, some did not; the metrics group applied a five-tool prefix list, the RnaSeq group
a two-tool one. A comparison that quietly ignores part of a file is worthless, so the rules that
say what is ignored now live in `manifest.json`, declared per suite, and this file is the only
thing that applies them.

The dump format, produced by the `*Dump.java` harnesses:

    <kind>\\t<case>\\t<payload>

one row per line, where the payload joins the record lines of a file with a *literal* backslash-n
(two characters), not a newline. That is why `SEGMENT_SEP` below is `'\\\\n'` and not `'\\n'`: a
comparison that split on real newlines would see one segment and silently canonicalize nothing.

Canonicalization rules are a closed set. Adding one is a reviewable event, because canonicalizing
is how a bit-identity claim quietly weakens.
