"""Check that every committed golden belongs to a declared conformance suite.

A golden that no suite regenerates has never been compared to anything but itself. Before the
manifest existed, seventeen of them were in that state: they were produced once, committed, and
read only by the Rust tests, so the Rust tests were asserting that the port reproduces a file of
unknown provenance. That is a strictly weaker claim than the one the README makes, and nothing in
the repository said which goldens were in which category.

This makes the condition mechanical. Only committed files count (`git ls-files`), so a golden
being written by an in-flight slice does not fail the audit before its suite lands.
