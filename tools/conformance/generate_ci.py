"""Generate the oracle jobs of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from `manifest.json`.

The workflow used to hold one hand-written pair of steps per suite: a `docker run` that
regenerated the golden and a thirty-line Python comparator inlined in YAML. At 39 suites that was
1556 lines, the comparators had already drifted from each other, and each new tool made the file
longer than the port it was testing. At 311 tools it would have been unreadable.

Now the suites are data. This script turns them into:

  * `oracle-image`, which builds the digest-pinned image once and caches it, and
  * `oracle`, a matrix with one entry per suite, so suites run in parallel and a broken suite no
    longer hides the ones after it in a single sequential job.

Usage:
    python3 tools/conformance/generate_ci.py            # write .github/workflows/ci.yml
    python3 tools/conformance/generate_ci.py --check    # fail if the committed file is stale
